# Java-ppts 

This repository contains all my relevant weekly programming assignments which I undertook during my very frist year at Imperial!

These include but are not limited to:-
- Functional Style programming 
- Picture Processing
- Muli-Threading and Concurrency 
- BST's, Red Black Tree implementations 
- Structures and Algorithms

These PPT's are an accurate representation of all the hardwork and dedication that was put in from my end towards
*Learning and advancing in programming*
